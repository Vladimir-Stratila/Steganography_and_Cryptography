# Steganography and Cryptography
A steganography/cryptography program is versatile: it can perform a variety of tasks based on the user's wishes. You may want to hide a message within an image, encrypt the text message for extra security, or decipher a hidden message you got from someone else.

Steganography is about hiding information in such a way that no-one would ever guess there's a secret message hidden right before their eyes.

You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on some web site, and only those who know will understand it. For maximum security, the message itself can be encrypted, as well.
