# Steganography and Cryptography
A steganography/cryptography program is versatile: it can perform a variety of tasks based on the user's wishes. You may want to hide a message within an image, encrypt the text message for extra security, or decipher a hidden message you got from someone else.

Steganography is about hiding information in such a way that no-one would ever guess there's a secret message hidden right before their eyes.
